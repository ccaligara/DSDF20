Hello Viewer!

Welcome to my Digital System Design (CPE-487) Repository!
I completed this class during the Fall 2020 Semester at Stevens Institute of Technology. This class was taught by Professor Kevin Lu.
My posts to this repository consist of the six laboratory assignments that we were tasked with completing during the semester.
Professor Lu provided his students with the necessary files to run each lab on our own FPGA. My labs in particular were run on a Nexys A7 50T.
To see my thought process, approach to each lab, resources I have used, and any modifications made, please see my website at:
